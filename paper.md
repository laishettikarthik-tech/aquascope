# Summary

AquaScope is an open-source Python toolkit (v0.6.0, MIT license) that unifies water
data collection from 19 global sources, comprehensive hydrological and statistical
analysis, agricultural water management, and AI-powered research methodology
recommendations into a single, coherent package. It addresses a persistent challenge
in water resources research: the fragmentation of data access, analytical methods, and
tooling across disparate software ecosystems. AquaScope normalises heterogeneous data
into unified Pydantic schemas, provides over 40 analytical methods spanning conceptual
rainfall-runoff modelling (GR4J with NSE/KGE/log-NSE auto-calibration), flood
frequency analysis, baseflow separation, extreme value theory, and FAO-56
evapotranspiration, and includes a knowledge-base-driven AI engine that recommends
appropriate research methodologies based on dataset characteristics. Unlike existing
unified data clients, which focus on United States services, AquaScope's collectors
span East and South Asia, Europe, and global FAO/UN sources. The toolkit is
available at <https://github.com/Rekin226/aquascope>.

# Statement of Need

Water resources research requires practitioners to navigate a fragmented landscape of
data sources, analytical techniques, and software tools. Streamflow records from the
U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) National Water Information System [@USGS_NWIS], water
quality observations from the Water Quality Portal (WQP), satellite-derived
evapotranspiration from FAO WaPOR, climate reanalysis from Copernicus ERA5, and
sustainability indicators from the UN SDG 6 database each expose different APIs, data
formats, and access patterns. Researchers typically write bespoke scripts for each
source, introducing inconsistencies and impeding reproducibility.

Beyond data access, the analytical methods themselves span multiple domains.
Flood frequency analysis following Bulletin 17C [@England2019] requires L-moment
estimation [@Hosking1997] and the Expected Moments Algorithm (EMA) for censored data.
Agricultural water management demands FAO-56 Penman-Monteith reference
evapotranspiration calculations [@Allen1998]. Change-point detection involves choosing
among PELT [@Killick2012], CUSUM, and Pettitt [@Pettitt1979] algorithms depending on
data characteristics. Multivariate dependence modelling requires copula families
[@Nelsen2006] with appropriate selection criteria. Each of these methods is often
available only in specialised packages with incompatible interfaces.

Existing open-source tools address subsets of these needs. The HyRiver suite
(`pygeohydro`, `pynhd`, `py3dep`) provides excellent, well-maintained access to United
States hydrological services and returns analysis-ready `xarray` and `geopandas`
objects; `dataretrieval` wraps USGS and multi-agency U.S. services; `hydrostats`
provides streamflow comparison metrics; and `pySTEPS` focuses on probabilistic
precipitation nowcasting. Two gaps remain. First, the mature unified-access clients are
**United States-centric**: a researcher working in Taiwan, Japan, Korea, India, the
European Union, or with global FAO/UN datasets must still assemble bespoke clients.
Second, no single toolkit couples multi-source data collection with a comprehensive
hydrological analysis suite, agricultural water management, advanced statistical and
machine-learning methods, and intelligent methodology guidance.

AquaScope addresses both. Its 19 collectors span East and South Asia (Taiwan MOENV and
WRA networks, Japan MLIT, Korea WAMIS, India WRIS), Europe (EU Water Framework
Directive), the United States (USGS, Water Quality Portal), and global providers
(GEMStat, Open-Meteo, Copernicus, UN SDG 6, FAO AQUASTAT and WaPOR). On top of this it
provides an end-to-end workflow, from raw data ingestion through analysis to methodology
recommendation, in a single, well-tested Python package with a unified API. It targets
hydrologists, environmental engineers, agricultural scientists, and water resources
researchers, particularly those working outside the United States, who need to combine
data from multiple sources and apply appropriate analytical methods without assembling a
patchwork of incompatible tools.

# Key Features

## Data Aggregation from 19 Global Sources

AquaScope implements collectors for 19 water data sources, each subclassing a common
`BaseCollector` and normalising responses into shared Pydantic schemas
(`WaterQualitySample`, `WaterLevelReading`, `ReservoirStatus`, `SDG6Indicator`). The
supported sources span Asia (Taiwan MOENV, Taiwan WRA water-level and reservoir
networks, Taiwan WRA FHY, Taiwan WRA IoT groundwater, Taiwan Civil IoT via the OGC
SensorThings API, Taiwan data.gov.tw, Japan MLIT, Korea WAMIS, India WRIS), Europe (EU
Water Framework Directive), the United States (USGS NWIS [@USGS_NWIS]; the Water
Quality Portal, aggregating 400+ U.S. agencies), and global providers (GEMStat,
covering 170+ countries; UN SDG 6; Open-Meteo; Copernicus CDS ERA5 reanalysis and
climate projections; FAO AQUASTAT country-level water withdrawal; FAO WaPOR satellite
evapotranspiration). Most sources share the unified `water_data` schema, while
aggregate or gridded sources (AQUASTAT, SDG 6, WaPOR) use purpose-built record types
that match their data shape. A shared `httpx`-based HTTP client [@HTTPX2024] provides
caching, automatic retries with exponential backoff, and rate limiting across all
collectors.

## Hydrological Analysis Suite

The hydrology module implements the GR4J conceptual rainfall-runoff model
[@Perrin2003] with parameter auto-calibration against Nash–Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE)
[@Nash1970], Kling–Gupta Efficiency (KGE) [@Gupta2009], and log-NSE objectives via a
shared model-evaluation metrics module. Flood frequency analysis uses Generalised
Extreme Value (GEV), Log-Pearson Type III (LP3), and Gumbel distributions, with
L-moment parameter estimation [@Hosking1997] and Bulletin 17C procedures including EMA
for censored data [@England2019]. Non-stationary GEV models with time-varying
parameters [@Coles2001] and regional frequency analysis with discordancy and
heterogeneity measures are also supported. Baseflow separation uses the Lyne–Hollick
[@Lyne1979] and Eckhardt [@Eckhardt2005] recursive digital filters and the UK Institute
of Hydrology (UKIH) smoothed-minima method. Additional capabilities
include flow duration curves with Weibull plotting positions, recession analysis,
22 hydrological signatures (magnitude, variability, timing, flashiness), and
power-law rating curve fitting with shift detection. Diagnostic tools include Q-Q
and P-P plots, return level analysis, and leave-one-out cross-validation with
coverage probability assessment.

## Agricultural Water Management

AquaScope implements the complete FAO-56 Penman-Monteith reference evapotranspiration
(ET₀) methodology [@Allen1998], including all intermediate calculations (psychrometric
constant, saturation vapour pressure, net radiation). A Hargreaves temperature-only
alternative is provided for data-sparse contexts. Crop water requirements are computed
for 20 crops using FAO-56 crop coefficients ($K_c$) across initial, mid-season, and
late-season growth stages. Irrigation scheduling accounts for effective rainfall, net
and gross irrigation demand, and application efficiency. A daily soil water balance
model tracks root-zone depletion with automatic irrigation triggers.

## Advanced Statistical and Machine Learning Methods

The statistical analysis capabilities include Bayesian uncertainty quantification via
conjugate linear regression and Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling [@Gelman2013],
copula dependence modelling with four families (Gaussian, Clayton, Gumbel, Frank) and
AIC-based selection [@Nelsen2006], change-point detection using PELT [@Killick2012],
CUSUM, Pettitt [@Pettitt1979], and binary segmentation algorithms, and extreme value
analysis with L-moment estimation and non-stationary GEV models [@Coles2001].
Trend detection uses the Mann-Kendall test [@Mann1945; @Kendall1975] and the
Standardised Precipitation Index [@McKee1993] for drought characterisation.

Machine learning models include ARIMA/SARIMA, Prophet, Random Forest, XGBoost, and
LSTM neural networks. Ensemble methods support weighted averaging, stacking, and
adaptive strategies. Transfer learning enables model reuse across catchments.

## AI-Powered Methodology Recommendations

A knowledge base of 26 research methodologies—spanning statistical analysis, machine
learning, time-series forecasting, process engineering, spatial analysis, hydrological
modelling, and policy assessment—drives an AI recommendation engine. Given a dataset
profile (computed automatically from the data), the engine scores each methodology
using rule-based heuristics matched against data characteristics (sample size,
parameter types, temporal extent, spatial coverage). An optional large language model
(LLM) integration provides natural-language reasoning about methodology suitability.
A HydroAgent interface enables conversational problem-solving for users who prefer
natural language interaction over command-line operation.

## Scientific I/O and Interoperability

AquaScope reads and writes OGC WaterML 2.0 [@WaterML2012] for standards-compliant
data exchange, HEC-DSS and HEC-RAS formats for U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
interoperability, EPA SWMM input files for urban stormwater modelling, and NetCDF and
HDF5 for multidimensional scientific data. GeoJSON export supports spatial
visualisation and GIS workflows.

## Spatial Hydrology

The spatial module provides DEM processing, D8 flow direction and accumulation
routing, automated watershed delineation, and Strahler stream ordering. These tools
enable catchment-scale analysis directly from elevation data without external GIS
software.

## Visualisation and Reporting

Sixteen plot functions cover time-series, box plots, heatmaps, spatial maps (via
Folium), flow duration curves, and hydrographs. Diagnostic panels provide Q-Q, P-P,
and return level plots for distribution fitting validation. An interactive Streamlit
dashboard with nine pages, including dedicated Hydrology, Extreme Events, and
Agricultural Water analysis labs, enables exploratory analysis without writing code.
Automated Markdown and HTML report generation with embedded figures supports
reproducible documentation.

# Design and Architecture

AquaScope follows a pipeline architecture:

```
Collectors (fetch + normalise) → Pydantic Schemas → Analysis → AI Recommender → Pipelines
```

**Collectors** implement `fetch_raw()` and `normalise()` methods, converting source-
specific JSON, XML, or CSV responses into unified Pydantic models. **Schemas** use
Pydantic v2 [@Pydantic2024] for runtime validation with full type annotations,
ensuring data integrity at ingestion boundaries. **Analysis modules** accept pandas
[@McKinney2010] DataFrames and NumPy [@Harris2020] arrays, using SciPy [@Virtanen2020]
for statistical computations. Internal result structures (`DatasetProfile`,
`Recommendation`, `PipelineResult`, `QualityReport`) use Python dataclasses rather
than Pydantic models, separating validation concerns from computation. The **AI
engine** scores methodologies against dataset profiles and returns ranked
recommendations. **Pipelines** are registered in a central registry and executed
by method identifier, returning standardised `PipelineResult` objects.

Lazy imports throughout the package ensure that only required dependencies are loaded,
allowing users to install minimal subsets (e.g., `pip install aquascope[viz]` for
visualisation only). A command-line interface exposes 14 commands (`collect`,
`recommend`, `eda`, `quality`, `run`, `hydro`, `agri`, `forecast`, `plot`, `alerts`,
`solve`, `dashboard`, `list-methods`, `list-sources`) for scriptable workflows.

The test suite comprises over 820 tests, including validation
against the CAMELS large-sample hydrology dataset [@Addor2017] for hydrological
signature computation. Continuous integration runs tests on Python 3.10–3.12 with
lint (Ruff) and type checking (mypy).

The HyRiver suite is the closest comparator for data access and is more mature for
United States services, returning analysis-ready `xarray`/`geopandas` objects;
AquaScope is positioned to interoperate with the same scientific-Python objects in a
forthcoming release. AquaScope is distinguished by combining data aggregation from 19
global sources, with coverage well beyond the United States, with a comprehensive
analytical toolkit and an AI-driven methodology recommendation engine in a single
package. While individual features overlap with specialised tools, no existing package
provides this integrated, geographically broad workflow from data collection through
analysis to methodology guidance.
