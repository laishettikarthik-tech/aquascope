# Contributing to AquaScope

Thank you for your interest in contributing to AquaScope! This project aims to be a community-driven resource for water researchers worldwide. Whether you are a hydrologist, environmental engineer, data scientist, or student — your contributions are welcome.

## Finding Something to Work On

- Browse issues labeled [`good first issue`](https://github.com/Rekin226/aquascope/labels/good%20first%20issue) — these are scoped, self-contained, and have clear acceptance criteria.
- Want to add your country's water data? See the pinned [**Data sources wanted**](https://github.com/Rekin226/aquascope/issues/11) meta-issue.
- **To claim an issue**, just comment on it (e.g. "I'd like to work on this"). A maintainer will assign it to you — outside contributors can't self-assign, so the comment is how we hand it over. This avoids two people doing the same work.

### The contributor ladder

We'd love for you to stick around past your first PR, so there's a clear path to grow:

1. **First PR** — start with a [`good first issue`](https://github.com/Rekin226/aquascope/labels/good%20first%20issue). Scoped, self-contained, clear acceptance criteria.
2. **Ready for more** — graduate to a [`good second issue`](https://github.com/Rekin226/aquascope/labels/good%20second%20issue): a slightly larger, self-contained piece (a new method, a new module) that builds on what you just learned. When we merge your first PR, we'll usually point you straight at one that fits.
3. **Area owner** — after a few PRs in one area (agriculture, hydrology, collectors, ...), we'll invite you to help **triage and review** issues there, and add you to [MAINTAINERS.md](MAINTAINERS.md). This is how contributors become maintainers.

Every merged PR is also credited in [CONTRIBUTORS.md](CONTRIBUTORS.md) and the README, code, tests, docs, data, and translations all count. If you want to take on more, just say so on any issue or in [Discussions](https://github.com/Rekin226/aquascope/discussions).

## Ways to Contribute

### 1. Add a New Data Source Collector

We want to cover water APIs from every country. To add a new collector:

1. Create a new file in `aquascope/collectors/` (e.g., `japan_mlit.py`).
2. Subclass `BaseCollector` and implement `fetch_raw()` and `normalise()`.
3. Map raw API fields to our unified schemas in `aquascope/schemas/water_data.py`.
4. Add tests in `tests/test_collectors/`.
5. Document the data source in your module docstring (API URL, required keys, datasets).

The cleanest reference to copy is `aquascope/collectors/usgs.py`, and there's a full walkthrough in
[`docs/guides/adding_data_source.md`](https://rekin226.github.io/aquascope/guides/adding_data_source/).

```python
from aquascope.collectors.base import BaseCollector
from aquascope.schemas.water_data import WaterQualitySample, DataSource

class JapanMLITCollector(BaseCollector):
    name = "japan_mlit"

    def fetch_raw(self, **kwargs):
        return self.client.get_json("https://api.example.jp/water/v1/quality")

    def normalise(self, raw):
        # Convert raw records into WaterQualitySample instances
        ...
```

### 2. Add a Research Methodology

To expand the AI recommender's knowledge base:

1. Open `aquascope/ai_engine/knowledge_base.py`.
2. Add a new `ResearchMethodology` entry to the `METHODOLOGIES` list.
3. Include: description, applicable parameters, data requirements, scale, complexity, references, and tags.
4. Add a test in `tests/test_ai_engine/` to verify your methodology is findable.

Or simply open an issue using the **New Research Methodology** template.

### 3. Improve the AI Recommender

The scoring algorithm in `aquascope/ai_engine/recommender.py` can be improved:

- Better heuristics for data sufficiency scoring
- Additional scoring dimensions (e.g., data frequency, parameter correlations)
- LLM prompt improvements for the enhanced mode

### 4. Add Notebooks / Tutorials

Example Jupyter notebooks in `notebooks/` help new users get started. Contributions in English, French, Chinese, or any language are appreciated.

### 5. Fix Bugs / Improve Docs

Bug fixes and documentation improvements are always welcome.

## Development Setup

```bash
# Clone the repo (or your fork)
git clone https://github.com/Rekin226/aquascope.git
cd aquascope

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
# .venv\Scripts\activate   # Windows

# Install in editable mode with dev dependencies
pip install -e ".[dev,all]"
```

## Before You Push: Make CI Green Locally

Our CI runs three required checks on every PR: **lint** and **test** on Python 3.10, 3.11, and 3.12. Run them locally first — it's much faster than waiting on CI:

```bash
# 1. Lint (this is the one that most often trips up first PRs)
ruff check aquascope/ tests/

# Auto-fix the easy stuff (import sorting, etc.) before committing:
ruff check aquascope/ tests/ --fix

# 2. Tests
pytest

# 3. Type checking — scope it to the file(s) you changed.
#    The repo has a known backlog of pre-existing mypy findings in other
#    modules; don't be alarmed by errors outside your change.
mypy aquascope/path/to/your_file.py --follow-imports=skip --ignore-missing-imports
```

> **First-time contributor?** GitHub holds the CI run on your first PR until a maintainer approves it (you'll see checks marked "action required" / pending). This is normal and not a problem with your code — we'll approve it. Running the checks locally as above means it passes first try.

## Pull Request Guidelines

1. **Fork** the repository and create a feature branch (don't work on `main`).
2. Write tests for new functionality.
3. Ensure `ruff check`, `pytest`, and (scoped) `mypy` pass locally.
4. Keep commits atomic and write clear commit messages.
5. Update documentation if you change public APIs.
6. Reference the related issue in your PR description (e.g. `Closes #8`).

## Code Style

- Follow PEP 8; enforced by `ruff`.
- Use type hints for all public functions.
- Write docstrings (Google or NumPy style).
- Keep modules focused — one collector per file, one concept per module.

## Reporting Issues

- **Bugs**: Use the Bug Report template.
- **New data sources**: Use the New Data Source template.
- **New methodologies**: Use the New Research Methodology template.
