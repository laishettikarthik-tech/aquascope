## Major features — leveling up

Ambitious, high-impact work that takes AquaScope to the next level. These are [`major feature`](https://github.com/Rekin226/aquascope/labels/major%20feature) · `help wanted` — larger than a weekend, mentorship available. Comment on the issue to discuss scope before starting.

- [ ] Prediction in Ungauged Basins — regionalize signatures/parameters ([#53](https://github.com/Rekin226/aquascope/issues/53)) — *now unblocked by the shipped GR4J keystone*
- [ ] Declarative, reproducible study runner `aquascope run study.yaml` with provenance ([#54](https://github.com/Rekin226/aquascope/issues/54))
- [ ] Plugin architecture — third-party collectors & methodologies via entry points ([#55](https://github.com/Rekin226/aquascope/issues/55))
- [ ] Large-sample CAMELS benchmark — automated accuracy report ([#56](https://github.com/Rekin226/aquascope/issues/56))

## Good first issues — up for grabs

Newcomers welcome. Just comment to claim one, then follow the [contributor ladder](CONTRIBUTING.md) (`good first issue` → `good second issue` → area owner).

- [ ] Edge-case tests for the FAO-56 ETo functions ([#40](https://github.com/Rekin226/aquascope/issues/40))
- [ ] Colorblind-safe plot palette in `viz/styles.py` ([#41](https://github.com/Rekin226/aquascope/issues/41))
- [ ] Edge-case tests for baseflow separation ([#42](https://github.com/Rekin226/aquascope/issues/42))

**Ready for more?** The [`good second issue`](https://github.com/Rekin226/aquascope/labels/good%20second%20issue) tier: Mann-Kendall trend test + Sen's slope ([#44](https://github.com/Rekin226/aquascope/issues/44)) and flow-duration-curve slope + runoff ratio ([#45](https://github.com/Rekin226/aquascope/issues/45)). _(UKIH baseflow #43 — ✅ shipped in #48.)_
