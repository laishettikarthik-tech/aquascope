# Changelog

All notable changes to AquaScope are documented here.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Daily Taiwan groundwater** (`collectors/taiwan_wra.py`):
  `TaiwanWRAGroundwaterDailyCollector` reaches the sub-annual (daily)
  groundwater-level series from the WRA gweb HydroInfo portal, which the
  open-data API does not expose (it tops out at annual statistics). Per-well
  records span roughly 2005-2025 (Zhuoshui/Choushui fan back to the late
  1990s). Supports zone aliases, date clipping, and `aggregate="monthly"`
  (the input to a Standardised Groundwater Index) or `"daily"`. Rate-limits
  and caches every request. This unlocks monthly SGI and SPI/SPEI
  drought-propagation analysis on AquaScope-collected data.

### Changed
- `CachedHTTPClient.post_json()` now sends a JSON body and shares the retry,
  rate-limit, and body-keyed disk-cache behaviour of `get_json()` (previously
  a thin wrapper with no body, retries, or caching).

## [0.7.0] — 2026-06-26

Interoperability and uncertainty: AquaScope now composes with the scientific-Python
geo stack and reports calibrated uncertainty on model output.

### Added
- **xarray / GeoPandas interop** (`io/interop.py`): `records_to_xarray()` converts
  time-series records to an `xarray.Dataset` (dims `(time, station_id)`, per-parameter
  variables, lat/lon coords); `records_to_geodataframe()` converts point records to a
  `geopandas.GeoDataFrame` (Point geometry, EPSG:4326). Every collector also accepts
  `collect(as_xarray=...)` / `collect(as_geodataframe=...)`. New `[interop]` extra (#70).
- **GR4J quantile prediction intervals** (`models/rainfall_runoff.py`): `predict_quantiles()`
  produces calibrated uncertainty bands via a residual or parameter-ensemble method
  (heteroscedastic option); the deterministic `simulate()` path is unchanged (#77).
- **Probabilistic metrics** (`analysis/metrics.py`): `pinball_loss`, `picp`, `mpiw`,
  `crps_ensemble`, and `crps_from_quantiles` for scoring interval and ensemble
  forecasts (#76).
- **Multi-basin UQ benchmark** (`examples/12_uq_camels_benchmark.py`): GR4J quantile UQ
  across the bundled CAMELS basins with per-basin and aggregate PICP/CRPS and a
  reliability diagram. On the bundled basins the residual method reaches ~0.90
  central-interval coverage against the 0.90 nominal target (#78).
- **Documentation**: an uncertainty-quantification guide and an updated xarray/GeoPandas
  integration guide.

### Changed
- `require()` gains a `group` override so optional-dependency errors point at the
  correct extra (e.g. `[interop]`).
- JOSS paper (`paper.md`) condensed and updated to v0.7.0 with the interop and UQ work.

## [0.6.0] — 2026-06-26

### Added
- **GR4J rainfall-runoff model** (`models/rainfall_runoff.py`): conceptual daily rainfall-runoff model with auto-calibration against NSE / KGE / log-NSE objectives (#52). This is the keystone modelling feature that turns AquaScope from a data + statistics toolkit into a simulation tool.
- **Shared model-evaluation metrics** (`analysis/metrics.py`): NSE, KGE, PBIAS, RMSE, and R² in one reusable module for scoring model predictions (#60).
- **GeoJSON export** for the `collect` command's `--format` option (#64).
- **Extreme-events module** (`analysis/extreme_events.py`): frequency analysis for hydrological extremes (annual maxima/minima series, return-period estimation), with type annotations on all public functions.
- **FAO-56 dual crop coefficient** (`agri/crop_water.py`): new Kcb + Ke mode separates basal transpiration from soil evaporation for more accurate crop water demand, alongside the existing single-Kc mode (#22, #49).
- **UKIH smoothed-minima baseflow separation** (`hydrology/baseflow.py`): adds the UK Institute of Hydrology block method (`ukih`) to the existing Eckhardt and Lyne-Hollick filters, exported via the public hydrology API (#43, #48).
- **India WRIS collector** (`collectors/india_wris.py`): river water-level data from India's Water Resources Information System (#15).
- **Dashboard data sources**: AQUASTAT, EU Water Framework Directive, Japan MLIT, Korea WAMIS, and WaPOR are now selectable in the Streamlit Data Collection page (#14).
- **Dashboard analytical pages**: the Streamlit app gains an **Extreme Events** page (block-maxima frequency analysis with return-level curves and bootstrap confidence bands), an **Agricultural Water** page (FAO-56 ET0 plus the single-Kc / dual Kcb+Ke irrigation workflow), and a **Flow Signatures** analysis plus UKIH baseflow option on the Hydrology page. All new pages ship offline demo-data fallbacks so they work without API keys.
- **`penman_monteith_series`** is now re-exported from `aquascope.agri` for daily ET0 over a weather DataFrame.
- **Edge-case tests** for `SoilWaterBalance` auto-irrigation (#35) and for the new modules.

### Fixed
- **Irrigation efficiency leak** (`agri/water_balance.py`): efficiency losses no longer leak into deep percolation, which previously inflated the groundwater-recharge term (#38, #39).
- **Collector HTTP robustness**: the WQP, Japan MLIT, and Korea WAMIS collectors now route every request through the shared `CachedHTTPClient`, so they get retries, rate-limiting, and disk caching like the other collectors. The Japan MLIT and Korea WAMIS collectors previously called a non-existent `client.get()`, which was swallowed by a broad `except` and made them return empty results on every call. A new `CachedHTTPClient.get_text()` method backs the WQP CSV path.
- **Taiwan WRA water level** (`collectors/taiwan_wra.py`): readings now carry station coordinates when the feed provides them (TWD97/WGS84 lat-lon keys) instead of always setting `location=None`.
- **USGS API key** (`collectors/usgs.py`): the collector no longer hard-defaults to the rate-limited `DEMO_KEY`. It reads `api_key=...` or the `USGS_API_KEY` environment variable, and warns before falling back to `DEMO_KEY`.

### Changed
- **Governance and contributor onboarding**: added `MAINTAINERS.md` with area owners, `.github/CODEOWNERS`, all-contributors recognition in `CONTRIBUTORS.md`, a contributor ladder in `CONTRIBUTING.md`, and a "Major features" plus "Good first issues" section in `ROADMAP.md`.
- **Test coverage gate** raised from 60% to 70% (`pyproject.toml`); added the first tests for `utils/http_client.py`, plus config tests for the USGS and Taiwan WRA collectors.
- **Documentation accuracy**: data-source count synced to 19 across README, docs, dashboard, and citation metadata; clarified that aggregate/gridded sources (AQUASTAT, SDG 6, WaPOR) use purpose-built record types rather than the unified `water_data` schema.
- **Software citation**: added `CITATION.cff`; bumped version to 0.6.0.

## [0.5.0] — 2026-06-05

### Added
- **Multi-provider LLM support** (`ai_engine/recommender.py`) — AI recommender now supports **HuggingFace Inference API** (free), **Groq** (free tier), **Ollama** (local), and OpenAI. `PROVIDER_BASE_URLS` and `PROVIDER_MODELS` constants are exported for dashboard consumption. JSON-object response mode enabled only where supported.
- **Dashboard LLM provider picker** — new `_render_llm_config()` UI lets users switch providers with free-tier links (HF + Groq) directly in the Streamlit dashboard.
- **USGS region filter** (`collectors/usgs.py`) — new `bbox` and `max_items` parameters cap paginated requests to a geographic bounding box and total record count. Dashboard exposes 5 preset US region filters (Northeast, Southeast, Midwest, Pacific Northwest, Southwest) plus custom bbox input.
- **SDG6 country picker** — dashboard Data Collection page replaces free-text ISO3 input with a 50+ country dropdown for the UN SDG 6 source.
- **WQP state picker** — US Water Quality Portal source now has a full US state dropdown in the dashboard.
- **Taiwan Civil IoT date filtering** (`collectors/taiwan_civil_iot.py`) — `start_date` / `end_date` parameters build OData `phenomenonTime` filter clauses automatically.
- **Dashboard source hints** — Taiwan WRA (level + reservoir) sources now show informational banners clarifying snapshot-only APIs; Taiwan MOENV exposes a record-count slider.

### Fixed
- **GEMStat collector** (`collectors/gemstat.py`) — completely rewritten: now downloads, caches, and parses the GEMStat Zenodo ZIP archive (~200 MB, cached to `data/cache/` after first call). Supports `country`, `parameters`, `start_date`, and `end_date` filtering. Previously returned only file metadata.
- **Taiwan WRA Reservoir collector** (`collectors/taiwan_wra.py`) — field names updated to match current API response format (lowercase keys: `reservoirname`, `dwl`, `inflow`, `outflow`, `capacity`, `nwlmax`). Storage percentage now computed from `capacity / nwlmax`.
- **Dashboard navigation** (`dashboard/app.py`) — fixed `StreamlitAPIException` caused by writing to a widget-bound `current_page` key after the radio widget was already instantiated. Navigation now uses a `_nav_pending` staging key applied before widget creation.
- **Viz backend guard** (`viz/styles.py`) — `_save_or_show()` no longer calls `plt.show()` when using the non-interactive Agg backend (eliminates `FigureCanvasAgg is non-interactive` warnings in CI and headless environments).
